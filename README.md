# Stone_Paper_Scissor_Game
A very old and gold game made to play with computer and written on Python.
Here I have used two modules and one of them is used for the basic functioning of the game.
This is a very simple python script but the basic idealogy of the game is to make computer choose something from stone, paper and scissors and then we have to choose one of the same.

When we run the program then we have to choose whether to play the game or to exit.

Then the script wants us to enter our name. So that the cpu can know with whom it is going to play.

Then after the basic greetings, the script gives an option to choose the whether we have to take out stone, paper or the scissors.

Oh! It was a draw let's try once more.

So after giving one more try we ultimately lost to the computer and the script mentioned the total points that I secured while playing the game.
